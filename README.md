Hackathon7 was done in react

This project was  a personal, Test, timed  project.
In this project there was a lot of work that was  done. 
This project was a personal project the Dev was allowed to pick what the project would be on and how to build it.
The qualifications for this project were to use the skills that the Dev has develpoed in react and impoment them here.
To make it a real life senerio the project came with no instuction other than the qualifications.
Other qualifications that were needed in this project were that it had to be done in a timely maner three days or seventy two hours.
As well as it had to have at least two Axios calls.
some of the blockers that happen in this project were the fact that it was hard to come up with an idea.
Not only that but the lay out of the project and the pressure of time to get it done.
As well as to get it done and fucntinal not only in the back end but the front end as well, the app had to function as inteded as well as be 
presentable to the  user in terms of the looks and the usability of the app.
In this project there were a lot of hoops that had to be jump threw to get to where the app needed to get to. 
Axios calls had to be done and the loners of such called some time had to authorize the call and just as  well the way that the 
two calls would bind together and work as  one unit insted of sepretly.
